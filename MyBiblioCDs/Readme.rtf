MyBiblioCDs
The idea for this little application is ata from the fact that I have many Audio CDs. Later I discovered that I have many CDs with old programs and Data.

Regarding audio CDs the program makes use of MusicBrainz (www.musicbrainz.org) and Discogs (www.discogs.com).
If you give an audio-CD the program looks up the title and artist and tracks. Generally more than one version of the same CD can be found. Once the version is chosen it can be saved in the DB.

The reason, though, that prompted me to create this little search engine for CDs, is the fact that when I have to search for some old program, or some particular function. Finding it with the programs provided by windows or linux became problematic. Insert the CD and start the search. Try again with another Cd and so on....
The program saves in the DB, the information about the files and the words they contain. As for program files, in addition to storing words, it is possible, after selecting parts of code, to enter explanatory notes, which will be saved in the DB.
For more details there is a small manual: MyBibliocdsHelp.chm 
In addition to all the application files there is an installation file (SetupMyBiblioCds.msi).

The program makes use of DLLs developed by me:
MusicBrainz, MyBiblioCDsAudio, PdftoText, TextBoxTime, ComboOpenCloseDrv, the project and code files are all over the place.

I wrote this program during my spare time.
